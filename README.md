_ElimiWaste:_

**Project Description:**
Food waste is a widespread problem for households across the world. The primary causes of consumer food waste are insufficient food planning and shopping habits. Individuals tend to purchase extra food items and face confusion over food expiration dates. To minimize future food waste, our solution allows for users to track their food inventory at all times, with regular notifications to inform about soon-to-expire products. Current applications have a lack of features or are too expensive and do not push out average expiration date information to solve the problem. This user-friendly, free-to-use Android application allows users to customize a unique food inventory at any time using both manual and OCR input. The smart recipe feature aids in suggesting food recipes that incorporate soon-to-expire ingredients. As privacy is one of our key values, this application will keep user data local to the device, while the food inventory will be using cloud storage for global implementation. The app will also be deployed on the iOS platform to broaden the appâ€™s appeal to audiences later on in the development process.
